- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nasasjanitor
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and plan on learning CSS, HTML and JavaScript in order to attempt making my very first website. I was not familiar with the world of Tech before I entered university so I am quite behind in knowledge compared to my peers, however I am trying my best not to let fear and insecurity get in the way of my desire to learn!
