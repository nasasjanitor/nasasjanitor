- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nasasjanitor
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and plan on learning CSS, HTML and JavaScript in order to attempt making my very first website. I was not familiar with the world of Tech before I entered university, however now I am rushing forward in order to catch up and make my share of contributions to the field!
