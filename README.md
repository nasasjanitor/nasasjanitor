- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ellie.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CSS, HTML, JavaScript and Python - and more! These are a few of the steps I have been taking ever since completing my CS degree in order to expand my portfolio and solidify my programming skills.

- I was not too familiar with the world of Tech before I entered university; however, now I am rushing forward to catch up. My biggest motivations are: the need to contribute to the world through technological developments and my mum.
